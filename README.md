# The Odin Project

## Project: Landing Page

This project will create an entire web page from a design.

They are providing us 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors weâ€™ve used.

And we should design it as close as possible to the given images.

### *Image One (Full Design) - Image Two (Color and Fonts)*
